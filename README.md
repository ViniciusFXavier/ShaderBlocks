# Shader Blocks

View [Demo](https://sketchpunk.github.io/shaderblocks/) : Only works on Chrome

**Purpose**:
Project to create a web based visual glsl shader tool, similar to apps like Shader Forge, Shader Graph, Shader Nodes in Blender, etc.

Really just an itch to scratch and fun to be had in building.
